# RIS-AidedChannelEstandLocalization_THzHybridFieldBeamSquint
Simulation codes of my paper: Sensing User's Channel and Location with Terahertz Extra-Large Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface under Hybrid-Field Beam Squint Effect[1].

There are still lots of imperfections in the codes and paper, and I would be honored if there is something desirable that could help you. That's also the reason why I made the code public. If there are mistakes, I will humbly accept them.
