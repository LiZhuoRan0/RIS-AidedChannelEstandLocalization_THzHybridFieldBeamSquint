# RIS-Aided Channel Est and Localization THz Hybrid Field BeamSquint

Simulation codes of my paper: Sensing User's Channel and Location with Terahertz Extra-Large Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface under Hybrid-Field Beam Squint Effect[^1].

There are still many imperfections in both the codes and the paper. I would be honored if anything within proves helpful to you. This is also why I've made the code public. If any mistakes are found, I will humbly accept and address them.
